            <p>Some riddles require out-of-the-box thinking and encourage people to look at things from new perspectives. On the other hand, some riddles are extremely literal. This set of riddles falls into the latter category, as all relevant information is included within the questions, and their solutions (particularly in a written format) are spelled out clearly. In retrospect, the solution to each of these riddles is simple, and it is impossible to unsee the solution after you have already figured it out. Yet sometimes, the most obvious solution is also the most overlooked. Remembering to consider the obvious, then, is the true challenge.</p>
