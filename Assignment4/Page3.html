            <span>A Green Glass Door...To pass through it, you must bring a gift. What will you bring?</span>
            <p>In the Green Glass Door game, an individual chooses a specific pattern or rule, and participants then take turns naming items which they believe adhere to the “rule”. In the initial, namesake version, the rule is that each gift must contain consecutive double letters, and this is indicated by the fact that the words Green, Glass, and Door, contain a double “e”, a double “s”, and a double “o” respectively.</p>
            <p>Participants’ responses must utilize the following format: “I am bringing this but not that”, where the first item listed follows the rule while a second, similar item listed is not acceptable according to the rule. On this webpage, the same format is followed. That is, the first words in each pairing (Alligator, Apple, Book, Cartoon, Glitter, Mitten, Parallelogram, Puzzle, Slipper, and Tool) each contain double letters, while their corresponding second words (Crocodile, Fruit, Novel, Animation, Sparkle, Glove, Quadrilateral, Jigsaw, Shoe, and Utensil) have no consecutive repeated letters.</p>
            <p>Green Glass Door is most commonly played by children – it is easy to implement in an elementary school classroom, and my sisters and I often played the game during long car rides. Simple rules, such as three-letter objects or red items, might not provide a challenge for older audiences, but the game can nonetheless be tailored to any age group. Rules relating to ten-letter objects, palindromes, or items that existed before the 20th century, for example, might not be guessed immediately even by older players. Other ways to make the game more challenging and engaging could include setting a time limit for participants to think of responses, combining two or three rules and requiring all conditions to be met for a response to be accepted, or including restrictive conditions (such as disallowing responses that contain the letter “e”).</p>
