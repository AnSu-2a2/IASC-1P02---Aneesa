            <p>The riddle, "Why did the chicken cross the road?" seems to be ingrained in popular culture, and there are countless versions in circulation. For example, “Why didn’t the chicken cross the road?” (Because there was a KFC on the other side, and “Why did the turkey cross the road?” (To prove he wasn’t chicken) (Jones, 2023). This webpage features not one but three chickens crossing the same road. The exact reason why they are crossing remains elusive, but perhaps they wish to reach the same side as the others. Or, of course, to avoid them.</p>
